  extracurricularActivities:
  - Developed programs to process millions of waveform data for river roughness analysis which can achieve results in a short time and reduce the risk of field work.
  - Developed a software for complex and multifunctional error adjustment processing and developing GUI and DLL as interfaces, can potentially save 3,000 USD per year.
