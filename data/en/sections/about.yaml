# a summary about you
summary: "Hi !ðŸ‘‹
<br>
I am a **Firmware** / **Software** / **DevSecOps** Engineer, and even an **Open-Source Contributor**, who love learning new things, solving problems, sharing technical skills and constantly improving myself.\n



At my current role, I've developed a systematic BIOS serial save feature (D4D), which saved engineers 20% of debugging time, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention. I am a firm believer in CI/CD automated BIOS code signing and auto-testing system to minimize bugs and speed up the release cycle.


As a **Technical Leader**, I led the team to successfully complete large-scale webGIS and software systems such as smart home land systems, satellite data storage systems and urban planning systems.


Outside of my day-to-day work, I contribute to open-source projects and stay engaged with the developer community through tech meetups and conferences. I am always seeking to learn new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of software firmware engineering trends.
Moreover, I am very familiar with the field of **Geomatics** which I provide free consulting services and welcome anyone interested in spatial data to discuss together.\n
